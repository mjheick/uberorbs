ÿ³Thank you very much for playing this semi-addictive game.

This is a 'family-created game'.  allow me to explain.

Myself is the person who wrote all the code for it.

Beta testers were my wife, my brother, and many friends with itchy mice.

The neato Icon was created by my brother, the very same one that beta tested the game.

Comments and suggestions were taken by non other than the people who beta tested it.  This helped to improve gameplay and overall experience.  You can thank them if you want :-)

The main inspiration for this was my mother.  I wanted to see if i could create a game that could make her addicted to it.  From the early tests, it's done good so far.
