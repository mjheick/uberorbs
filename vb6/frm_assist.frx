ÿ‹UberOrbs! is a very simple game to play.  

Simply take your mouse, and click anywhere on the play area.  This will initiate the first 'explosion', which if any other orbs contact this explosion area will explode themselves.

If you get the required amount of orbs to explode, you will be able to move to the next level.  Greater levels provide more orbs to destroy with a greater amount of them.

If you choose to ramp up the difficulty, enable 'Rubber Orbs' from the options menu.  This will cause the orbs to 'bounce' off of each other.  You will have a much harder time trying to time when an orb will be within the kill zone.

Much fun!
